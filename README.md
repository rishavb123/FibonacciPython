# FibonacciPython

Welcome to Fibonacci Python! This is a language that lets you use the fibonacci numbers as the number of spaces for each tab. So your first indent will be 1, second is 2, third is 3, fourth is 5, fifth is 8, and so on. This program will take that input and compile it into normal 4-space tabbed python.

Also, you get the inconvenience of using a script to compile your program, but still only have the speed of an interpreted langauge. Theres no reason not to switch over.
